## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Setting up an online food ordering system for your restaurant is a bit of
work initially but will provide you with many long-term benefits.

### Save money: 
Many third-party services like Uber Eats and Delivero take a commission of up to 30% from every order. Setting up your own online ordering system will mean some upfront costs, but once you‚Äôre up and running, you‚Äôll only have to pay a subscription fee and small transaction fee. Square Online charges just 2.2% per transaction on your restaurant website when your customers place an order online, with no
monthly fees on our free plan. 

### Receive larger orders: 
Customers feel less rushed when ordering food online. Studies have shown that orders placed via an online ordering system are likely to be larger ‚Äì you‚Äôre also able to add up sell suggestions when a customer is checking out with most online ordering systems. ÔÇ∑ Enjoy flexibility and control: Whether it‚Äôs displaying your items differently, creating bundles, or offering multiple delivery options, an in- house online ordering system puts you in charge. 

### Keep your customers: 
Third-party sites list your restaurant along with many others offering similar cuisine, putting you at risk of losing loyal customers. Your own online ordering system will keep your customers
coming back and away from tempting competitor offers.
